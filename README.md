# SaiKet System Internship
This repository contains six complete Java programs, each designed to strengthen foundational programming skills in Java, including object-oriented programming, exception handling, file I/O, user input processing, and algorithmic thinking.

A sample text file (sample.txt) is also included for testing the Text File Analyzer program.

## 📝 Task Descriptions

### 🔢 1. Calculator Application
File: ```CalculatorApp.java```\
A menu-driven calculator that performs:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with division-by-zero handling)
- Square root
- Power operations
  
Concepts used: Methods, functional interfaces, conditions, exception handling.

### 🌡️ 2. Temperature Converter
File: ```TemperatureConverter.java```\
Converts temperatures between:
- Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
- Celsius ↔ Kelvin
  
Concepts used: User input handling, mathematical formulas, menu-based interaction.

### 📝 3. To-Do List Application
File: ```TodoApp.java```\
A console-based application where users can:
- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- View all tasks
- Save tasks to a text file
- Load tasks automatically on startup
  
Concepts used: OOP (Classes & Objects), Lists, File I/O, exception handling.

### 🎮 4. Number Guessing Game
File: ```NumberGuessGame.java```\
A simple guessing game where the user must guess a number randomly generated by the program.
Features:
- High/Low hints
- Tracking number of attempts
- Quit anytime

Concepts used: Random numbers, loops, conditions, scanner input.

### 📄 5. Text File Analyzer
File: TextFileAnalyzer.java
Analyzes any .txt file and reports:
- Total lines
- Total words
- Total characters
- Occurrences of a specific searched word
Includes a ready-to-use sample.txt file.

Concepts used: File I/O, string manipulation, exception handling, word/token processing.

### 🏦 6. Basic Banking System

File: ```BasicBankingSystem.java```\
Simulates a simple banking system with:
- Account creation
- Deposit
- Withdrawal
- Transfer between accounts
- Viewing balances
- Viewing transaction history

Concepts used: OOP (classes, objects, methods), collections, validations, exception handling.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Programs
### Compile: -

```javac FileName.java```

### Run: -

```java FileName```

Each program is standalone and requires only the standard Java SDK (Java 8+ recommended).

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By exploring this repository, you will learn:
- Java fundamentals
- Conditionals and loops
- Exception handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Working with Lists and ArrayLists
- File Input/Output
- Designing interactive console applications
- Problem-solving with Java

## 🧪 Included Test File
### Sample.txt
A sample text file used by ```TextFileAnalyzer.java``` for testing.
Contains multi-line text, repeated words, and simple formatting.
